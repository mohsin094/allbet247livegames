<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>Rake refers to the scaled commission taken by a casino to pay for its operating costs. Rake is collected in tournaments as part of the buy-in cost and in cash games by the dealer dropping a percentage of each pot.</span></p>
<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>If you&rsquo;ve ever played cash game poker in a casino, you&rsquo;ve probably seen the dealer taking chips out of the pot during most hands &mdash; those chips are the casino&rsquo;s rake.</span></p>
<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>Just to state the obvious: more rake is <strong>NOT</strong> better.</span></p>
<h2 style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:116%;font-size:21px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;color:#0F4761;font-weight:normal;background:white;'><strong><span style='font-size:30px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#0A0A0A;'>How is Rake Collected?</span></strong></h2>
<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>There are 3 common methods used by cardroom to collect rake (ordered from most to least common):</span></p>
<h3 style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:116%;font-size:19px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;color:#0F4761;font-weight:normal;background:white;'><strong><span style='font-size:24px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#0A0A0A;'>1. Pot Rake</span></strong></h3>
<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>The most common type of collection, pot rake is generally 2.5% to 10% of the pot in each hand, usually up to a predetermined maximum amount. Some card rooms, however, take a set amount of rake from the pot regardless of pot size.</span></p>
<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>Some cardrooms do not take any rake until the flop is dealt, so if you raise preflop and take down the blinds, you win the whole pot. This is called &ldquo;no flop, no drop&rdquo;.</span></p>
<h3 style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:116%;font-size:19px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;color:#0F4761;font-weight:normal;background:white;'><strong><span style='font-size:24px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#0A0A0A;'>2. Time Collection</span></strong></h3>
<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>Time collection (also &ldquo;timed rake&rdquo; or &ldquo;table charge&rdquo;) is a set fee collected (typically) every half-hour during the game. This form of rake is collected in one of two ways:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style='line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;font-size:13.5pt;color:#595858;'>Player time: A set amount is collected from each player.</span></li>
    <li><span style='line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;font-size:13.5pt;color:#595858;'>Time pot: A set amount is collected from the first pot over a certain amount.</span></li>
</ul>
<p > 
   <span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>Time rakes are generally reserved for higher limit games ($10&ndash;$20 and above).</span></p>
<h3 style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:116%;font-size:19px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;color:#0F4761;font-weight:normal;background:white;'><strong><span style='font-size:24px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#0A0A0A;'>3. Dead Drop</span></strong></h3>
<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>A set amount of rake is placed on the dealer button each hand by the player in that position, which the dealer collects before any cards are dealt.</span></p>

<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>How does this affect your decisions? <strong>In a nutshell, higher rake forces you to play a tighter style of poker.</strong></span></p>
<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>This means that all those marginal postflop calls become folds. Moreover, this has an effect on the preflop ranges since those marginal open-raises, calls, and 3-bets depended on those marginal value bets, bluffs and calls to be profitable.</span></p>
<p ><span style='font-size:18px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#595858;'>Consequently, you have to play tighter preflop <em>and</em> postflop.</span></p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Before we get into each of the ten poker hands in detail, let us understand what is a poker hand?</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Meaning of Poker Hand</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Typically, five cards make a poker hand.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Suppose if you have the cards 5-6-7-8-9 in random suits, then the poker hand that you have made is straight.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Suppose if you get &hearts;3 &hearts;7 &hearts;9 &hearts;Q &hearts;A, then you make a flush.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If you observe the second example, you can see that all the cards have the same suit. That is the heart&apos;s suit (&hearts;).</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Every combination of five cards in poker is given a name such as royal flush, straight, two pair, and so on. This five-card combination is called the &lsquo;poker hand&rsquo;.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">There are ten poker hands. Find out their rankings below.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Now let us look at the other set of rules.</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">How Does a Poker Game Begin?</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Let&apos;s take the example of Texas Hold&apos;em Poker, which happens to be the most popular poker game worldwide.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">You will now learn how to play poker by following the rules provided below.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Rule 2: Place the Blinds or Place the Ante on the Poker Table</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Place the Bet</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Let us first understand what blinds are and how they are placed, followed by what are antes.</p>


<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">What are Blinds?</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">To start a poker game, two players sitting to the left of the dealer must put an initial amount known as blinds.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Types of Blinds</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Two types of blinds exist. They are the small blind and big blind. The person sitting to the immediate left of the dealer puts</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">a small blind and the player to the left of the small blind puts a big blind.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">For example, if there are 6 players on a poker table in a game of Texas Hold&rsquo;em. &nbsp;The first player to the left of the dealer is the small blind,</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">and the player to the left of the small blind is the big blind.</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Types of Blinds</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Check cards Dealt</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Bet, call or raise after each round is dealt if you want to.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Look at the &ldquo;flop&rdquo; to see if you have a good hand.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Check the &ldquo;turn&rdquo; card after the second round of betting.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Examine the &quot;river&quot; card and decide on the hand you&apos;ll play.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Reveal each player&rsquo;s hand clockwise in the final &ldquo;showdown.&rdquo;</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Blinds Examples</p>


<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">How Is the Game Fair If Only Two Players Place a Blind and The Rest of The Players Stake Directly?</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">To ensure fairness, the responsibility of placing the small and big blind rotates among the players in every round.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Let&apos;s consider an example with six players in a game of Texas Hold&apos;em poker. Players A, B, C, D, E, and F are participating.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If player A is the small blind and player B is the big blind in the first round of the game.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Then in the next round, player C will be the small blind and Player D will be the big blind.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Following that, player E will be the small blind and player F will be the big blind. This makes the game fair and exciting.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Now Let Us Get to What are Antes</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Ante</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">An ante is a compulsory stake that every player has to place on the table. For example, if there are six players</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">in the game and the pre-decided ante for the game was ₹1. Then all the players must put the ante stake on the table before the cards are dealt.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The betting round starts after the antes are placed on the table. The players must put antes before the beginning of every round.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The player to the immediate left places the first ante and the rest of the players follow.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Difference Between Blinds and Ante</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Though blinds and antes are initial stakes, and the purpose of blinds and ante is to motivate the players to stake money in the game,</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">it is important to know that blinds and antes are different.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The blinds are forced stakes but only the two players to the left of the dealer place it and the dealer moves one position to the left with each hand.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">In private games with friends, the antes are more common. All the players have to put the mandatory bet known as the ante.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Blinds are popular in casino environments and big stakes.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Typically, a poker game will either use the ante or the blinds but not at that same time.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Let us now have a look at how cards are dealt with in rule number 3. The first game that you can start playing as a beginner is texas hold &lsquo;em.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Have a look at all the rules given below to learn how to play poker texas hold em.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Rule 3: Dealing of Cards</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Dealt with Cards</p>


<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">There are mainly two types of cards in poker. They are &lsquo;hole cards&rsquo; and &lsquo;community cards.&rsquo;</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">What are Hole Cards?</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Hole cards are the individual cards given to players. Only the individual players can see the hole cards.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">What are Community Cards?</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Community cards are available for all the players. They can be used to form a good poker hand.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Since we are considering texas hold&rsquo;em poker, let us look at the dealing of hole cards and community cards in texas hold&rsquo;em poker.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">How Are the Hole Cards and Community Cards Dealt in Texas Hold&rsquo;em?</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Players are dealt a total of two hole cards and five community cards in texas hold&apos;em.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">First, the players place the small blind and big blinds on the poker table.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Placing Bet</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The dealer shuffles the cards, and then &lsquo;burns&rsquo;, i.e., discards the first card in the deck.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Then the dealer gives two cards to all the players.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Poker Positions</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">In every dealing round in poker, the dealer will burn a card.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">As a result, it is more difficult for players to predict which card will be dealt with next, and the game becomes more unpredictable.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The dealer will always deal with the cards clockwise, starting on the left, and working his way around the table.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Tip: Until the showdown, players will not show their hands to anybody else. It is preferable to keep your cards hidden even if another player is out.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">You do not want them to divulge the value of your cards by mistake or on purpose.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Rule 4: Bet, Check, Call, Raise</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Bet, Call, Raise</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Bet, Call, and Raise betting options for poker players.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If you choose to, you can bet, call, or raise in each round.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">You will place a bet every time the dealer deals with new cards.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The first bet is based only on the two cards that the players have in their hands. This is known as playing the &lsquo;pre-flop&rsquo; round.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Betting is done in a clockwise direction, and you have a few options when it is your turn to take the betting action.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Betting Actions</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Players have the option to:</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Stake: If no one else has placed a bet yet make the first wager.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Check: To avoid betting, say &quot;check.&quot;</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Call: To match a bet made by someone else, say &quot;call.&quot;</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Raise: To add more money to the betting pool, say &quot;raise.&quot;</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Fold: If you do not want to play that hand, you have the option to &ldquo;fold&rdquo;, that is, not playing a poker hand.</p>


<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Flop Poker</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">To see if you have a decent hand, look at the &quot;flop.&quot;</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The dealer would &ldquo;burn&rdquo; the top card of the deck after the first round of betting, and then they will lay out three cards face-up on the table, known as the &quot;flop.&quot;</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">These are the community cards that can be used to form a hand by any player.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">You need to compare these cards to the ones in your hand before deciding whether to bet, call a bet, or fold.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The dealer will reveal five cards in total in the poker flop.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">You will have a total of seven cards to use to make your finest five-card hand: two hole cards in your hands and five community cards on the table.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">While your luck may change later in the game, look over the table after the &quot;flop&quot; to see if you are in a solid position to finish the game with a good hand.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Rule 6: Check the Turn</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Turn Poker</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">After the second round of betting, check the &quot;turn&quot; card.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The dealer burns one card.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Then they place one card face up next to the flop, which is called the turn or fourth street.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">To determine if you want to bet, call, or raise in poker, look at all the cards on the table as well as the cards in your hand.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">At this stage, your game may enable you to switch cards, but this is not common in professional games.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Consider the possible hands of the other players as you examine the cards.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Let us say, that all four cards on the table are spades, for example, any player holding a spade will have a flush,</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">which implies they have five cards from the same playing card suit.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">In the same way, if the cards on the table are 5,6,7, 8, anyone who has a 4 or 9 will have a straight.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If you have nothing decent in your hand, but the cards on the table make for an easy winning hand, you should fold because another player is likely to have a winning card.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Rule 7: Examine the River</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">River</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Examine the &quot;river&quot; card before deciding which hand to play.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">After you &ldquo;burn&rdquo; the top card on the deck, the dealer will place one final card face up next to the &quot;turn&quot; card. The &quot;river&quot; is the name of the final card.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">To determine the best five-card hand, examine both your hand and the community cards.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Then decide whether to bet, call, or fold in poker.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Tip: When you have good cards that are of the same suit or you have at least one pair, it is alright to bet aggressively since this will force</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">players to assume you have a good hand. The pot also increases with this tactic. There are high chances that the rest of the players will back down.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">But keep an eye out for players who match your bets.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Rule 8: Showdown</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Showdown in Poker</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">In the final &quot;showdown,&quot; reveal each player&apos;s hand clockwise.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">After each player calls, folds, or stakes in the previous round, the players remaining in the game will participate in the &quot;showdown&quot;.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">All players participating will show their cards face up, starting to the left of the dealer.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Then everyone looks at the hands that have been handed over to discover who has the best hand to win the pot.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If there is a tie, the pot is shared between the players who have a tie.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">You will not have to show your cards if you fold your hand.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">There are 5 cards on the table and 2 cards in your hand in Texas Hold&apos;em. These 7 cards can be used to make any 5-card combination.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The cards that are left are not counted.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">This is referred to as &quot;playing the board&quot; if you simply wish to play the cards on the table.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">However, because it is a choice that everyone has, it may not be the greatest one.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Strategy and Betting</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When you are learning how to play poker game, the rules related to strategy and betting are important.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Calculate The Risks Associated with Your Starting Hand</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Best Starting Hands</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Best Starting Hands</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Worst Starting Hands</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Worst Hands in Poker</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Examine your cards to see what you have.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Look for a pair, two consecutive numbers, cards from the same card suit, or face cards that could be useful.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Then determine whether it is worth it to place a wager to see what the community cards are.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When you have a pair, face cards, or aces in your hand, you should nearly always raise.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Strong hands include an ace and a king or an ace and a queen. If you have these hands, you should bet before the flop to increase the pot&apos;s value.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If you do not get the card you need, you can either bluff or fold.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Know that a bad beat can be turned around with good bluffing abilities and a little luck.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">1. Betting Starts in Clockwise Direction</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Place the Bet</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The betting begins to the left of the big blind in the first round.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Bets are placed in a clockwise direction in poker.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Betting starts with the player to the left of the dealer if you are playing a game with an ante instead of a blind.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">2. Call the Poker Hand if Necessary</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Poker Call</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If you want to stay in but do not have great hands, call the bet.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">This indicates that you wish to stay in the game but not increase your table stake.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When you call in poker, add your chips or money to the pot to match the previous player&apos;s bet.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">3. Raise The Bet for Good Poker Hands</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Raise the Bet</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If you have a strong hand, raise your bet.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Tell the other players you wish to raise the bet when it comes to you.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Then, declare your bet and place your money or chips into the pot and end your turn.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">For example, you can say, &ldquo;I raise the bet to $40&rdquo;.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Please note that a bet cannot be raised more than the maximum amount allowed for a game.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Bluffing: To make everyone think you have good cards; you can decide to raise the stakes. This is referred to as &quot;bluffing in poker.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">&quot; It is a tactic for winning a hand despite having weak cards. You can &quot;bluff&quot; at any time during the game, but it is a riskier approach because your bluff could be called.</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">4. Fold To Avoid Major Losses</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Poker Fold</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If you have a weak hand or the current bet is too high, fold.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">This signifies the end of the poker game.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Fold your cards by placing them face down on the table and saying, &quot;I fold.&quot;</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Add your cards to the discard pile after that.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When you fold during a game, do not show your cards because this will reveal which cards are no longer in play.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">This could provide some players an advantage.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Knowing whether to fold your hand and accept a smaller loss versus holding on to it and risking a higher loss for a chance to win the pot is crucial for poker wins.</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">5. Only Use Money You are Willing to Lose When You Play</p>
<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Poker cash</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When you are first starting, you should never risk more than you are willing to lose.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Do not add to your bankroll during the game, and do not go back in after losing all of your money.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Before you play another game, be sure you are comfortable losing that amount again.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">As a general guideline, you should be able to comfortably lose 200 bets at the maximum limit.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">So, if the maximum stake is $5, your bankroll should be $1000, and you should stop there.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If you want to get serious about poker, keep track of your wins and losses.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">This will assist you in determining whether you are winning or losing over time.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">To stay out of legal difficulties, keep track of your gaming earnings and pay taxes on them.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Poker Faces</p>


<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">In poker, it is perhaps even more crucial to play your opponents than it is to play your cards. &nbsp; This is a more complex component of the game,</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">but it is always a good idea to be mindful of your tells.</p>


<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Keep an eye out for betting tendencies like betting early, betting often with weak hands, or late in a hand as intimidation.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Physical tells can also assist you to estimate your opponent&apos;s hand strength and keep your strategy hidden by avoiding certain patterns.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Shallow breathing, sighing, flaring nostrils, flushing red, eyes watering, blinking, excessive swallowing, or a rising pulse</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">in the neck or temple are all typical telltale signs.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A hand over the mouth is used to hide a smile, whereas a hand over the eyes is used to reveal a smile.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A hand over the lips usually hides a smile, whereas shaking hands show uneasiness.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When the flop arrives, if a player looks at his or her chips, they most likely hold a powerful hand.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A mediocre player who stares you down to impress you is most likely poker bluffing.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">7. Determine Which Players Are Conservative and Which Are Aggressive</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Somewhat boring. Doesn&apos;t make as much money as TAGs or LAGs.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Enormously high skill levels are required to make a profit consistently.</p>


<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Determining which players are conservative and which are aggressive will make it easier for you to figure out players&apos; betting tendencies and read them.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Those who fold early, obviously only sticking in a hand when their cards are good, can detect if players are more conservative.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Extremely cautious players may not lose as much money, but they will be quickly identified by more experienced players.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">They are easily bluffed into folding because they avoid high betting.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Risk-takers and aggressive players frequently stake large amounts early in a hand before observing how the other players react to their cards.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Observe experienced players and consider how you would react if you were in their shoes.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Then, to develop your instincts, observe how experienced players react.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Shuffle the Card</p>



<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Before dealing the cards, shuffle them and cut the deck.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">To make the game fairer, the cards are shuffled.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Split the deck into two stacks for a basic shuffle.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Then, in each hand, hold a stack close together and face each other.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">To combine the deck, use your thumbs to flick through the cards.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">After the cards have been shuffled, have someone other than the dealer split the deck into two stacks and place the bottom stack on top.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Make multiple shuffles to ensure that the cards are evenly distributed.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">someone else raises during their turn.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If another player raises on that hand, neither you nor anyone else can say &quot;check&quot; or maintain their check.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When the action comes back to you, you must either match the bet, that is call the bet, or raise the previous bet, or fold your poker hand.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If everyone checks, you can either discard and draw 1 to 3 cards, or you can &quot;hold pat&quot; on the cards you have.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If there are less than three cards left to draw, replacement cards will be drawn.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The discards must be shuffled and added to the bottom of the draw stack.</p>

<p  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">or &quot;fold.&quot;</p>

  <h1 style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">How to Play Backgammon</h1>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The Play Players take turn rolling the dice. A player may move his checkers based on the number rolled by the dice. Each die has a separate value,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">meaning that a player may move two different checkers in one roll, as long as each checker is moved exactly the number of points shown on a die.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Checkers can land on one of three types of &quot;open&quot; points:</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">An empty point,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A point occupied by the player&apos;s own checkers (one or more),</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A point occupied by a single checker (a blot) owned by your opponent.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Landing on a blot, an unprotected checker, sends your opponent&apos;s man to the bar. When you land on a blot, the software will put your opponent&apos;s checker on the bar.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The checker remains on the bar until its owner succeeds in returning it to the game, by rolling a number corresponding to an open point in the opponent&apos;s home board.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If the player does not roll a number on either die which corresponds to an open space in the opponent&apos;s home board, the turn is forfeited.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If you roll doubles; meaning, both of the dice show the same number, you can move the equivalent of twice the roll. For example; if you roll a double three,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">you can move three points four times. You may move one checker three points four times, two checkers twice each, or any other combination.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">There is no limit to the number of checkers that may occupy a point, as long as they are all the same color.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Your turn is over when you select done or when you click on the dice.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When all your checkers are in your home board, you can start bearing off. The first player to bear off all of his checkers wins the game.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If you are hit while you are bearing off, you must reenter your checker from the bar into your opponent&apos;s home board,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">and move it back into your home board before you can resume bearing off. If you bear off all of your checkers before your opponent begins to bear off,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">you have &quot;gammoned.&quot; A gammon earns you double the stake of the game.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">If all of your checkers have been removed from the board and your opponent has not removed any and still has a checker in your home board,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">then the stakes are tripled. This is known as backgammon. Added to the doubling that may have been done using the doubling cube,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Winning Tips</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Keep your checkers in pairs to protect them from hits.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Don&apos;t hit your opponent when there are two or more blots in your home board.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Stake out six points in a row to keep your opponent from progressing. Make sure not to leave any blots in the row of six. This is known as forming a &quot;prime&quot;.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Set up protected points on your opponent&apos;s home board as potential safe places to land if you are hit. These are known as &quot;anchors&quot;.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Start out with small stakes until you are sure of your backgammon strategy.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">has finished bearing off. In this case, the winner receives three times the value of the doubling cube.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The Cube</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The cube, also called the doubling cube, is a cube with one of the following numbers on each of its six sides: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The cube is used for one player to offer the other the option of doubling the stakes of the game.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">In match play, the first game in which one player is a single point from winning is called the Crawford game, and the Crawford rule states that during this game,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">no doubling is allowed. Game values can still be doubled or tripled in gammon or backgammon wins.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A Beaver</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When a player immediately redoubles and retains ownership of the cube, it is called a beaver. His opponent may accept or refuse the redouble.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">There are three main game plans (strategies): run, block, and attack.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Running Strategy</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A running strategy employs as little interaction with the opponent as possible.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Blocking Strategy</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">In a blocking strategy, the player attempts to build blockades.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Attacking Strategy</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">In an attacking strategy, the player hits and closes out the opponent by controlling the points in his home board.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A Holding Game</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A holding game is a game played using a defensive, or blocking, strategy.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">End Play</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">End play is the portion of the game when at least one of the players has started to bear off.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A Contact Position</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A contact position is a point at which checkers are still engaged and still may hit or block each other.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">A Pure Race</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When all of the checkers are heading for home with no opponent checkers on the way and the players&apos; goal is to move forward as quickly as possible,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">the game is referred to as a pure race.</p>`,pokerVsBackgammon:`<div><img style="max-width: 1000px;" src="/assets/images/pokerVsBackgammon.jpg"></div>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Backgammon vs. Poker: Is there a Big Difference?</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Backgammon and poker have often been shown as games of a similar nature.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Both of them require a certain amount of skill and luck for the player to win.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The backgammon vs. poker argument has been an ongoing debate for decades yet we need to look</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">at all the facts before we can determine whether, for example, backgammon rules affect the outcome</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">of the game in the same way poker rules do, and the skills required in each.</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">When we consider backgammon vs. poker, we can see that both games are relatively simple to understand.</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Also, the best strategy for both games is to make the objectively best move possible.</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">In poker, you will need a sound mathematical basis in order to get far. Backgammon skills,</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">How ever, don&apos;t require that you be tops in maths. Also, you will need to do some long</p>
<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">planning in backgammon.</p>


<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The general consensus remains that, when looking at the skills/luck ratio between backgammon vs. poker,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">we can see that they are generally the same. However, you require more skill to play backgammon</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">in the long run. While you will always have two sides of the coin in the backgammon vs. poker debate,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">what is for sure is that both games are equally thrilling.</p>


<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The game of backgammon is the oldest board game known to mankind. It is so old that the facts</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">concerning the origination are mostly left to speculation. Many believe the birth of a version</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">of this great game emanated in Mesopotamia some 4,000 years ago (give or take a millennium),</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">and is rooted in the tradition of rolling animal bones to predict the future and gamble on the present.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Some believe the eastern borders of Iran should receive birth credit. Excavation digs have revealed</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">that Egyptian pharaohs played a version of the game (called Senet). The Romans played an offshoot</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">of Senet (called Tabula).</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The game we enjoy today uses many of Hoyle&apos;s rules (established in 1745) and incorporates one of</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">the catalysts to backgammon&apos;s popularity, the doubling cube (introduced approximately</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">80 years ago - inventor unknown). This advancement enabled players to bring one-sided games</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">to a quick conclusion. In addition, games in which one player held a moderate advantage became more</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">exciting, and required more skill.</p>`,BackGammonHistory:`<div><img style="max-width: 1000px;" src="/assets/images/BackGammonHistory.jpg"></div>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">It&apos;s one of the oldest board games in the world right now! The backgammon board game appears difficult at first,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">but once you understand it, it&apos;s effortless.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">Two players take turns moving pieces across the board and taking out the opponent&apos;s pieces from the board.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">The game has been played the same way for as long as historians can remember. But just as every rule has an exception,</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">so does the backgammon game that developed around the world over the years.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">You see! Backgammon dates back to almost 5,000 years ago, and the earliest evidence relating to the game was found among the ancient ruins of long-gone civilizations.</p>

<p style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">It is indeed remarkable how this game has survived several millenniums, and maybe the answer to its durability lies in its simplicity.</p>`,pokerHistory:` <div><img style="max-width: 1000px;" src="/assets/images/pokerHistory.jpg"></div> <h1

  <span style='font-size:20px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#181818;'>The game we know as
    poker is believed to have ancient roots that go back nearly 1,000 years, crossing several continents and cultures.
    Some historians say poker&rsquo;s origins can be traced to a domino-card game played by a 10th-century Chinese
    emperor; others claim it is a descendant of the Persian card game &ldquo;As Nas,&rdquo; which dates back to the 16th
    century.</span></p>

  <span style='font-size:20px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#181818;'>Poker&rsquo;s closest
    European predecessor was Poque, which caught on in France in the 17th century. Poque and its German equivalent,
    pochen, were both based on the 16th-century Spanish game primero, which featured three cards dealt to each player
    and bluffing (or betting high on poor cards) as a key part of the game.</span></p>
<p
  style="color:#0A0A0A; margin:0 0 5px 0">

  <span style='font-size:20px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#181818;'>&nbsp;French colonists
    brought Poque to their settlements in North America, including New Orleans and the surrounding area, which became
    part of the United States thanks to the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. English-speaking settlers in the region
    Anglicized Poque to poker and adopted features of the modern game, including five cards for each player and (by
    1834) a 52-card deck.</span></p>

  <span style='font-size:20px;line-height:116%;font-family:"Open Sans",sans-serif;color:#181818;'>From there, poker
    spread up the Mississippi River and throughout the country, thanks in part to its popularity among crews of
    riverboats transporting goods via that great waterway.&nbsp;</span></p>
